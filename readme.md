# Face Recognition from Webcam

This project demonstrates how to use face recognition technology to identify individuals from a webcam feed. It utilizes the `face_recognition` library for detecting and recognizing faces, and `opencv-python` for capturing and displaying video from the webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python modules installed:

- `face_recognition`: For face detection and recognition.
- `opencv-python`: For capturing video from the webcam and displaying images.

You can install these modules using `pip`. Open a terminal in VSCode and run:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python
